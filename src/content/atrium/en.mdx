**Climate change affects everyone, everywhere - therefore no person, country or time zone is excluded from the virtual Climate:Red Summit, organised by the network of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent and open for everyone to join.**

Climate:Red will bring together people from all around the world, creating a truly global platform to debate and inspire climate action.

The summit features over **200 intriguing sessions** for you to choose from. One week before the summit you can start browsing the programme and build your own schedule for 9 – 10 September.

During the summit, you can:

- listen to our fascinating array of speakers from ministers to scientists to CEOs to people in remote communities driving climate change initiatives every day;
- hear innovative ideas and climate projects in our innovation pitch tent and vote on your favourites to win;
- discuss solutions with other practitioners, campaigners, researchers and decision makers working for climate;
- meet people from all around the globe in random virtual coffee chats;
- take virtual tours of climate projects, play real time climate games… and more!

A summit is about connecting, inspiring each other, learning together and building new ideas and initiatives. In Climate:Red you will be able to do just that.

The sessions are arranged around four tracks:

**ACT**

What is the RCRC doing on climate? And what more do we need to do? These problem- and solution-oriented sessions will be based on experiences and lessons learned, and seek to accelerate action across the Red Cross Red Crescent network.

**EMPOWER**

What can we share and give to others? How can we support volunteers and communities we work with to address climate risks? These sessions will focus on capacity building, awareness-raising, community engagement and local leadership.

**INFLUENCE**

How can we leverage our auxiliary role and partnerships to influence change and raise ambition globally? Focus of these sessions will be on policy engagements and humanitarian diplomacy from local to global level.

**TRANSFORM**

What changes are needed in the ways we work? How can we be fit for the future in a changing climate? In these sessions we will look at innovations, greening and organisational changes.

You can choose from various session types: panels and discussions, workshops, live Q&A with experts, Ignite Talks, games for learning and dialogue, fishbowls, doctor-patient clinics and virtual tours. In our innovation pitch tent you will hear innovative ideas and climate projects and vote on your favourites to win.
