# Welcome to our global, digital climate change summit!


**Climate change affects everyone, everywhere. Therefore, no person, country or time zone is excluded from the virtual Climate:Red Summit, organised by the network of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. By bringing together people from all around the world, we create a truly global platform to debate and inspire climate action.**

The summit features over 200 intriguing sessions for you to choose from. During the summit, you can listen to our fascinating array of speakers from ministers to scientists to CEOs to people in remote communities driving climate change initiatives every day; hear innovative ideas and climate projects in our innovation pitch tents and vote on your favourites to win; discuss solutions with other practitioners, campaigners, researchers and decision makers working for climate; meet people from all around the globe in random virtual coffee chats; take virtual tours of climate projects, play real time climate games… and more!

After registering and logging in, check out our What’s on section for interesting sessions and inspiring speakers. One week before the summit you can start browsing the programme and build your own schedule for 9 – 10 September. 

A summit is about connecting, inspiring each other, learning together and building new ideas and initiatives. In Climate:Red you will be able to do just that. 

We can’t wait to meet you here!
