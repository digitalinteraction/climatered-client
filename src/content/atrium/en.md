# Hello world

Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? I was part of something special. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Just my luck, no ice. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Yes, Yes, without the oops! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

I was part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You really think you can fly that thing? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
