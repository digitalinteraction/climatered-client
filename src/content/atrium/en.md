# Welcome to our global, digital climate change summit!


**Climate change affects everyone, everywhere. Therefore, no person, country or time zone is excluded from the virtual Climate:Red Summit, organised by the network of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. By bringing together people from all around the world, we create a truly global platform to debate and inspire climate action.**

First, please register [here](https://climate.red/register). One week before the summit, you can start browsing the programme and build your own schedule for 9 – 10 September. Check also What’s on section for some interesting sessions and inspiring speakers. 

During the summit, in addition to our engaging panels, sessions and workshops, you can connect with people from around the globe in coffee chats.

You can read more about the Red Cross and Red Crescent network’s collective vision on addressing climate change as a humanitarian emergency from our [Strategy 2030](https://future-rcrc.com/strategy-2030/) and [The Movement Ambitions to Address the Climate Crisis](https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/02/Movement-Climate-Ambitions-2020-final.pdf). Our [Climate Training Kit](https://www.climatecentre.org/training) might also be a useful resource for you.

A summit is not just about listening, but connecting, inspiring each other, learning together and building new ideas and initiatives. In Climate:Red you will be able to do just that. 

We can’t wait to meet you here.
