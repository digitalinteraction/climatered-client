# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) - Climate Red Host

## Host Details

**Can I edit details of my session?**

The deadline to edit your details on [Host Access Area](https://go.climate.red/sessions) is September 4th. Your session details cannot be changed beyond the deadline.

**When is the deadline for sending my ignite talk and how can others see it?**

Ignite talks should be submitted no later than the 4th September. They will be scheduled into the summit agenda and you will be notified of the time of your video playing. Usually they will be in a playlist with 2-3 other ignite talks with similar subjects as yours. Ignite talks are played inside the climate:red platform, so make sure to ask your audience to register and join the event.

Chat function will be open in the platform during your talk. You should be online and introduce yourself as the presenter so that people can meet the star and ask you questions.

**I’m arranging for interpretation, how do I communicate this and manage it?**

You should let us know you intend to provide translation by emailing climateredsummit@climatecentre.org. Add it also to your abstract. Your session will then be available on the languages that you are interpreting for. Managing interpretation can be tricky if you haven’t done it before, but it is easy to learn. We recommend zoom as a platform. If you want some tips write to solferino.academy@ifrc.org

**What if my session overlaps with another one that has a similar target audience?**

With over 200 sessions in the summit, this is bound to happen, just like it does in any conference of this volume. You just have to make sure that you promote your session widely to your networks and that you have an interesting title to get people excited by your session.

I have a pre-recorded video/statement I would like to use in my session. How should I share this?
If you are using it in your session, you will have to manage this yourself. However, if you want us to use it to help promote your session, then send it to solferino.academy@ifrc.org

## Communications

**We’re preparing a flyer/communication for our session. Is there a template or certain logos we should use?**

We have a range of [communications tools available](https://future-rcrc.com/2020/08/31/climate-red-communications-pack) . Feel free to use these. Creating your own short ‘selfie video promoting your session and the summit can also be a good way to get people to join. Remember to use the climate.red link to the platform, and if using social media please use the hashtag #ClimateRed. Once the schedule is published, your session will be available for registration.

## Technology

**If I have to set up my session, which platform is best? How many people can teams, skype for business take? How do I set up my own zoom account?**

Different platforms are good for different things; you can see some of our advice [here](https://future-rcrc.com/2020/06/09/register-for-climatered-virtual-summit/#tools). Zoom for instance is good for interpretation and small group work, but unless you have a premium account, you can only have 100 people and it only works for 40 minutes. Google meet is free but doesn’t have some of the functions Zoom has. There are a lot of options available, so do some research and use what you feel most comfortable and confident with. [This table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLLniPkf48CCZyG_BNy1ylF2wXNlztqNEOnzNuMQmJc/edit#heading=h.z6d7tgqcpugp) from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) might be helpful.

**Can I use the IFRC Zoom account?**

Generally, if you are hosting your own session you should provide your own digital meeting platform (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft teams etc). We are offering the conference Zoom account to a limited number of sessions, but we are prioritising those from low income countries and those with headline feature sessions. However if you don’t have any options please contact us at solferino.academy@ifrc.org and we will see what we can do.

**Do all participants (including speakers) need to register for Climate:Red, or can I just share the link of my session with people?**

Yes, all participants need to register, including the speakers. The good news is that the registration process is very easy. Once people are registered and logged in, they are able to access the full agenda of the summit, join coffee chats and enjoy the whole conference experience. It also helps us to know how many people are participating.

**What technical support will be offered for my session, and what do I need to cover?**

If you are hosting your own workshop, you will need to manage the platform and participants yourself. We would love to support everyone, but there are over 200 sessions at the Summit and we can’t host them all. However, if you want some help, we are running training sessions for hosts Session Host Orientation Sessions on September 8th for critical information before the summit starts and any further questions you may have answered:

- September 8th - 10am CEST - [Register](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArdOGurDkjGNWp5UAsbX7J5lgEEaTpv0D1)
- September 8th - 5pm CEST - [Register](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYkde2pqD4pE9BuT_yNxxHfUXIZSR2ACobq)
- We have also produced a [handbook](https://future-rcrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Climate-Red-Session-Hosts-Handbook-0820-B.pdf) with helpful suggestions for hosts. If you need some extra advice reach out to us at solferino.academy@ifrc.org

During the summit we will have volunteers online ready to answer questions through a chatbot. We strongly recommend that if you are hosting and moderating the session yourself, you get a friend or a colleague to help you and list their email as the primary contact info. Otherwise you may get a lot of emails from people wanting to join while you are already busy hosting your session.

**Can I set up a restricted entry for my session so that only selected participants can enter?**

Yes you can, but you must notify us of this right at the start of your abstract. You can add this through the [host access area](https://go.climate.red/sessions), and we will put an announcement of limited places available next to your session. People will be able to register their interest for your session. Their info is then sent to you and you can choose how many and who you want to have access. You will then send them a link to your session. This link will not be available to the general public on the climate.red platform.

**Will people be able to register for my session beforehand?**

Yes, the full schedule will be available before the summit, and participants can register their interest to attend your session. You will be able to see how much interest there is for your session to help you plan accordingly. A lot of people are registering to this summit, so it's possible that your session might be very popular. You should note though often people express interest in attending something and then don’t turn up. (We all have friends like that). So expect that not everyone will show up. Vice versa, many people may not register interest until just before the session, or just turn up without even registering interest.
