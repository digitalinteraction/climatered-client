# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) - Climate Red Host #


## Host Details##

**Can I edit details of my session?**

The deadline to edit your details on [Host Access Area](https://go.climate.red/sessions)  is September 4th. Your session details cannot be changed beyond the deadline.

**When is the deadline for sending my ignite talk and how can others see it?**

Ignite talks should be submitted no later than the 4th September. They will be scheduled into the summit agenda and you will be notified of the time of your video playing. Usually they will be in a playlist with 2-3 other ignite talks with similar subjects as yours. Ignite talks are played inside the climate:red platform, so make sure to ask your audience to register and join the event.

Chat function will be open in the platform during your talk. You should be online and introduce yourself as the presenter so that people can meet the star and ask you questions. 

**I’m arranging for interpretation, how do I communicate this and manage it?**

You should let us know you intend to provide translation by emailing climateredsummit@climatecentre.org. Add it also to your abstract. Your session will then be available on the languages that you are interpreting for. Managing interpretation can be tricky if you haven’t done it before, but it is easy to learn.  We recommend zoom as a platform. If you want some tips write to solferino.academy@ifrc.org 

**What if my session overlaps with another one that has a similar target audience?**

With over 200 sessions in the summit, this is bound to happen, just like it does in any conference of this volume. You just have to make sure that you promote your session widely to your networks and that you have an interesting title to get people excited by your session. 

I have a pre-recorded video/statement I would like to use in my session. How should I share this?
If you are using it in your session, you will have to manage this yourself.  However, if you want us to use it to help promote your session, then send it to solferino.academy@ifrc.org

## Communications ##

**We’re preparing a flyer/communication for our session. Is there a template or certain logos we should use?**
 We have a range of [communications tools available](https://future-rcrc.com/2020/08/31/climate-red-communications-pack) .  Feel free to use these.  Creating your own short ‘selfie video promoting your session and the summit can also be a good way to get people to join.  Remember to use the climate.red link to the platform, and if using social media please use the hashtag #ClimateRed. Once the schedule is published, your session will be available for registration.
